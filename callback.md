## Importance of Callbacks

> A **callback** is a function passed to another function to be executed later.

- ✅ They enable **asynchronous programming**, allowing programs to continue working while waiting (e.g., for a network request or a timer) instead of freezing.
- 💡 Think: _“When you’re done, call me back with the result.”_

## Issues with Callbacks

### 1. Callback Hell

**Problem:**  
Too many nested callbacks inside each other make code look like a staircase to the right (pyramid of doom), making it hard to read and debug.

**Example:**

```js
getUser(id, (u) => {
    getOrders(u.id, (o) => {
        getTotal(o, (t) => {
            console.log(t);
        });
    });
});
```

> **Tip:** To avoid callback hell, consider using **Promises** or **async/await**.

### 2. Inversion of Control

**Problem:**  
When passing a callback to someone else’s code, that code decides **when/how/often** your function runs.

- **Risks:** It might call your callback twice, never call it, or call it with bad data—you don’t fully control it.
- **Fix:** Promises give guarantees (settles once, either resolve or reject), and async/await builds on that, restoring predictable control flow.

### Quick one-liners you can say:

- “Callbacks enable non-blocking work by running later.”
- “Callback hell = deeply nested callbacks that hurt readability.”
- “Inversion of control = someone else decides when my callback runs; Promises/async help regain control.”

## Analogies to Remember (Student Edition)

### 0. Importance of Callbacks

Callbacks let code run later, after something finishes.
👉 **Analogy (Homework):** Teacher gives you homework and says:
"When you finish, show me your notebook."
That instruction to “show the notebook later” is the callback. Without callbacks, you’d just sit and wait until the homework is done.

### 1. Issues with Callbacks

#### a. Callback Hell

Too many callbacks inside each other → code becomes messy.
👉 **Analogy:**
Teacher says:

First, finish Math homework → then call me.
After that, start Science project → then call me.
After that, do English essay → then call me.

Now your notebook looks like a staircase of instructions, super hard to follow. That’s callback hell.

#### b. Inversion of Control

You trust someone else to call your function at the right time, but you don’t control it.
👉 **Analogy:**
You gave your notebook to a class monitor saying:
"Submit this to teacher when I’m done."
But what if the monitor:

- Forgets to submit,

You’ve lost control → this is inversion of control.

✅ **Memory Shortcut:**

- Importance → Callback = “Show notebook later.”
- Callback Hell → Homework staircase → too many subjects one after another.
- Inversion of Control → Class monitor messes up submission.
